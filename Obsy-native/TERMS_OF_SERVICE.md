### License to Us
By using Obsy, you grant us a limited license to:
- Store and sync your data to provide the service
- Process your content through our AI systems to generate insights
- Display your mood tags and profile to friends in albums you join

This license exists solely to operate the App. We don't use your content for advertising, training AI models, or any purpose beyond providing you the service.

You agree not to:
- Upload illegal content
- Use Obsy to harass, abuse, or harm others
- Attempt to reverse engineer, hack, or compromise the App
- Create multiple accounts to abuse free tier limits
- Share content in albums that violates others' privacy without consent

## AI-Generated Insights

### What They Are
Obsy uses AI (Google Gemini) to generate reflective insights based on your captures, moods, and journal entries.

### What They Aren't
- **Not therapy.** Obsy is not a mental health service.
- **Not medical advice.** Don't use insights for health decisions.
- **Not always accurate.** AI can misinterpret, hallucinate, or produce unexpected results.

### Your Responsibility
AI insights are for personal reflection only. If you're experiencing mental health challenges, please consult a qualified professional.

---

## Albums & Social Features

### Shared Content
When you add a capture to an album:
- Album members can see your mood tag and capture timestamp
- Album members **cannot** see your journal entries
- You can remove your captures from an album at any time

### Behavior
Be respectful in shared albums. We reserve the right to remove users who:
- Harass other members
- Share inappropriate content
- Violate these Terms

---

## Service Availability

### No Guarantees
We strive for 99.9% uptime but don't guarantee it. The App may be:
- Temporarily unavailable for maintenance
- Affected by factors outside our control
- Modified or updated at any time

### Changes to the Service
We may add, modify, or remove features at any time. If we make changes that significantly affect your use, we'll notify you in advance when possible.

---

## Termination

### By You
You can delete your account anytime. This removes all your cloud data.

### By Us
We may suspend or terminate your account if you:
- Violate these Terms
- Abuse the service
- Engage in fraudulent activity

We'll provide notice when possible, but reserve the right to act immediately in serious cases.

---

## Disclaimers

### "As Is" Service
Obsy is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We don't guarantee:
- Uninterrupted service
- Error-free operation
- That insights will be accurate or useful
- That the App will meet your specific needs

### Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law:
- We're not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages
- Our total liability is limited to the amount you paid us in the past 12 months (or $100, whichever is greater)

This isn't us being unfriendly — it's standard legal protection that lets us offer the service.

---

## Legal Stuff

### Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Georgia, United States.

### Dispute Resolution
Before filing any lawsuit, you agree to contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute informally for at least 30 days.

### Entire Agreement
These Terms, plus our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and Obsy.

### Severability
If any part of these Terms is found unenforceable, the rest remains in effect.

## Changes to Terms

We may update these Terms as Obsy evolves. When we make significant changes:
- We'll update the "Last Updated" date
- We'll notify you in-app
- Continued use after notice means you accept the new Terms
