# Obsy Market Research & Go-To-Market Strategy

## Executive Summary

Obsy sits at the intersection of three growing trends: visual-first social apps (BeReal, Locket), casual mental wellness (not clinical), and AI personalization. The opportunity is in markets where therapy culture is less dominant but self-reflection is valued.

---

## Target Demographics

### Primary: Gen Z (18-26)
- **Why:** Visual-native, Instagram/TikTok fluent, open about mental health but resistant to "therapy speak"
- **Behavior:** Daily phone usage 4+ hours, prefer quick capture over long-form journaling
- **Pain point:** Want self-reflection without feeling like they're "doing therapy"

### Secondary: Young Millennials (27-34)
- **Why:** Established enough to pay for apps, value personal growth
- **Behavior:** Tried journaling apps and abandoned them, want lower friction
- **Pain point:** Busy schedules, need micro-moments not 20-minute sessions
